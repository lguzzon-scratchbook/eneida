# demo01

Project goals:<br />
* Create abstract, real-time animations by writing simple, low-level code.
* Explore math, procedural generation techniques, and audio programming.
* Eventually, create a demoscene production which could be submitted to demo party.
<br />

Project rules:<br />
* Code is fully standalone, it compiles by running <b>make.bat</b> from <b>src</b> folder on any Windows machine (no Visual Studio or any other software is needed).
* No external headers or libs are required (not even system or libc headers).
* All needed compilers are present in <b>compiler</b> folder.
* <b>C99</b>, <b>x86_64 ASM</b> and <b>HLSL</b> languages are used.
* Header files cannot include other header files (except very simple types.h).
* <b>Vim</b> is used to write code and <b>WinDbg Preview</b> to debug it.
