# Demo01

### Project goals:<br />
* Create interesting, real-time animations by writing simple, low-level code.
* Explore math, procedural generation techniques and audio programming.
* Eventually, create a demoscene production and submit it to a demo party.

### Project rules:<br />
* The most important rule is: Write only the code that you need and make it as simple as possible.
* Code is fully standalone, it compiles by running <b>Build.bat</b> on any Windows machine (no Visual Studio or any other software is needed).
* No external headers or libs are required (not even system or libc headers).
* Only external functions used are <b>LoadLibrary</b> and <b>GetProcAddress</b>. Everything else is loaded at runtime.
