# demo01

Project goals:<br />
* Create beautiful, real-time animations by writing simple, low-level code.
* Explore math, procedural generation techniques, CPUs, GPUs and audio programming.
* Eventually create a demoscene production which can be submitted to demo party.
<br />

Projects rules:<br />
* Code is fully standalone, it compiles by running <b>make.bat</b> from <b>src</b> folder on any Windows machine (no Visual Studio or any other software is needed).
* No external headers or libs are required (not even system or libc headers).
* All needed compilers are present in <b>compiler</b> folder.
* Only <b>C99</b> and <b>HLSL>/b> languages are used.
* Header files cannot include other header files (except very simple types.h).
